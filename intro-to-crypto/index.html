            <h3>What is Cryptocurrency?</h3>
          <p><b>A cryptocurrency is a digital currency, which is an alternative form of payment created using encryption algorithms. The use of encryption technologies means that cryptocurrencies function both as a currency and as a virtual accounting system. To use cryptocurrencies, you need a cryptocurrency wallet.<br></b>

             A cryptocurrency is a digital currency that only has value dependent on those who back it. For security, cryptocurrencies rely on blockchaining: a database organized in such a way that records are kept secure through peer-to-peer networks. Each record is kept within a block, and each block holds a timestamp and link to the block before it. The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, implemented in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p > <b>In the caveman era, people used the barter system, in which goods and services are exchanged among two or more people. For instance, someone might exchange seven apples for seven oranges. The barter system fell out of popular use because it had some glaring flaws:</b><br>
                
               <span class="bo">&#x3e;</span> People’s requirements have to coincide—if you have something to trade, someone else has to want it, and you have to want what the other person is offering.<br>
               <span class="bo">&#x3e;</span>There’s no common measure of value—you have to decide how many of your items you are willing to trade for other items, and not all items can be divided. For example, you cannot divide a live animal into smaller units.<br> 
               <span class="bo">&#x3e;</span>The goods cannot be transported easily, unlike our modern currency, which fits in a wallet or is stored on a mobile phone.

            <h3>Benefits of Cryptocurrency
            </h3>
           <p><span class="bo">&#x3e;</span> With cryptocurrency, the transaction cost is low to nothing at all—unlike, for example, the fee for transferring money from a digital wallet to a bank account.<br>   <span class="bo">&#x3e;</span> You can make transactions at any time of the day or night, and there are no limits on purchases and withdrawals.<br>  <span class="bo">&#x3e;</span> And anyone is free to use cryptocurrency, unlike setting up a bank account, which requires documentation and other paperwork.
