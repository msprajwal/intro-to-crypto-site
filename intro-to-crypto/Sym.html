                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Blockchain is the core database technology behind bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
                            Blockchain is now a major industry that has birthed several billion-dollar companies.
                            One of the most successful blockchain companies is Coinbase, an online cryptocurrency broker with annual revenues of nearly $6 billion.</li>
                            <li>Other major players have scored big profits by building mining hardware, investing, or providing exchange platforms.</li>
                            <li>The blockchain industry is still relatively young but is growing rapidly. Blockchains are distributed databases shared among the nodes of computer networks. They are best known for the role they play in cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions.</li>
                            <li>Blockchains guarantee the authenticity and security of a record of data and generate trust without the need for a trusted third party. Companies within the industry include financial technology (fintech) companies, cryptocurrency miners, manufacturers of blockchain technology, and other kinds of companies</li>
                    </ul>

                <h1>Timestamping</h1>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to "prove" the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party.</li>
                        <li>The first timestamping scheme invented was the proof-of-work scheme. The most widely used proof-of-work schemes are based on SHA-256 and scrypt.[26]</li>
                        <li>Some other hashing algorithms that are used for proof-of-work include CryptoNight, Blake, SHA-3, and X11.</li>
                        <li>Another method is called the proof-of-stake scheme. Proof-of-stake is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency. It is different from proof-of-work systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions.</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h1>Mining</h1> 
                <P>
                    <ul>
                        <li>On a blockchain, mining is the validation of transactions. For this effort, successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward. The reward decreases transaction fees by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network.</li>
                       <li>With more people venturing into the world of virtual currency, generating hashes for validation has become more complex over time, forcing miners to invest increasingly large sums of money to improve computing performance. Consequently, the reward for finding a hash has diminished and often does not justify the investment in equipment and cooling facilities (to mitigate the heat the equipment produces), and the electricity required to run them.</li>
                       <li>Some miners pool resources, sharing their processing power over a network to split the reward equally, according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a block. A "share" is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid partial proof-of-work.</li>
                    </ul>
                </P>

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A node is a component of cryptocurrency required for most popular currencies such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin, to function. In addition, itâ€™s an essential component of the blockchain network, a decentralized ledger used to keep track of cryptocurrencies.</li>
                        <li>Nodes determine whether or not a block of transactions is legitimate and accept or reject it.</li>
                        <li>Nodes save and store transaction blocks (storing blockchain transaction history).
                            This transaction history is broadcast and disseminated by nodes to other nodes that may need to synchronize with the blockchain ( updates on transaction history are important).</li>
                        <li>Node owners are either volunteers, those hosted by the organization or body responsible for developing the cryptocurrency blockchain network technology, or those who are enticed to host a node to receive rewards from hosting the node network.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A cryptocurrency wallet is a means of storing the public and private "keys" (address) or seed which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency.[74] With the private key, it is possible to write in the public ledger, effectively spending the associated cryptocurrency. </li>
                    <li>There exist multiple methods of storing keys or seed in a wallet. These methods range from using paper wallets (which are public, private or seed keys written on paper), to using hardware wallets (which are hardware to store your wallet information), to a digital wallet (which is a computer with a software hosting your wallet information), to hosting your wallet using an exchange where cryptocurrency is traded, or by storing your wallet information on a digital medium such as plaintext.[75]</li><br>
