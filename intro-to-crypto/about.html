                <p>Cryptocurrency is produced by an entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate which is defined when the system is created and which is publicly stated. In centralized banking and economic systems such as the US Federal Reserve System, corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency.</p>
                <h3>Blockchain</h3> 
                    <p> Blockchain is the core database technology behind bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
                    Blockchain is now a major industry that has birthed several billion-dollar companies.
                    One of the most successful blockchain companies is Coinbase, an online cryptocurrency broker with annual revenues of nearly $6 billion.
                </p>
                <h3>Timestamping</h3> 
                <p>Cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to "prove" the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party.

                    The first timestamping scheme invented was the proof-of-work scheme. The most widely used proof-of-work schemes are based on SHA-256 and scrypt.[26]</p>
                    <h3>Mining</h3> 
                    <p>On a blockchain, mining is the validation of transactions. For this effort, successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward. The reward decreases transaction fees by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network. The rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized machines such as FPGAs and ASICs running complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and scrypt.</p>

                <h3>Nodes</h3> 
                <p>A node is a component of cryptocurrency required for most popular currencies such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin, to function. In addition, itâ€™s an essential component of the blockchain network, a decentralized ledger used to keep track of cryptocurrencies.</p>
                <h3>Wallets</h3> 
                <p>A cryptocurrency wallet is a means of storing the public and private "keys" (address) or seed which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency.[74] With the private key, it is possible to write in the public ledger, effectively spending the associated cryptocurrency. With the public key, it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet.</p>
